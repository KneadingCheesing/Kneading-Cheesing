# AI-Assisted Interpretation of Single-Cell RNA-seq Data

## Overview

This project explores the safe and interpretable application of large language models (LLMs) to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Our goal is to build an LLM-powered pipeline that helps translate high-dimensional gene expression profiles into biologically meaningful insights ‚Äî while ensuring scientific alignment, explainability, and safety.

This research is part of our application to the [Anthropic External Researcher Access Program](https://www.anthropic.com/researcher-access), where we seek API support to evaluate Claude's performance in the context of biomedical data.

## Objectives

- üìä Interpret gene expression clusters using Claude
- üß† Generate hypotheses for cell-type-specific gene regulation
- üìö Integrate literature-based knowledge with scRNA-seq data
- ‚úÖ Evaluate safety, hallucination rates, and biological plausibility of LLM outputs
- üîç Compare different prompting strategies for scientific alignment

---

## Research Questions

1. Can Claude provide accurate and interpretable summaries of scRNA-seq clustering results?
2. How does prompt structure impact the alignment and scientific validity of outputs?
3. What are the best practices for LLM integration into biomedical analysis pipelines?

## Why LLMs for Biology?

Single-cell RNA-seq produces complex, sparse datasets that require expert interpretation. We believe Claude and other frontier LLMs can:
- Accelerate insight generation
- Enable natural language querying of biological patterns
- Improve reproducibility and transparency in computational biology

## Tools & Methods

- Claude API (via Anthropic)
- Seurat / Scanpy for scRNA-seq preprocessing
- Prompt engineering with domain-specific biological context
- Evaluation by human domain experts
